If you'd like to support the podcast, you can do so by [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/denolfe).

(ElevenLabs text to speech isn't the cheapest 😅).

## Credit

Deep inspiration from the, now discontinued, [Hacker News Recap](https://hackernewsrecap.buzzsprout.com) podcast.

## Contributing

The podcast itself is quite close to how I want it.

Please open an issue if:

- You have a suggestion to improve the podcast, more than willing to hear them.
- You noticed any mispronunciations by ElevenLabs TTS. Specific words/patterns can be adjusted accordingly.
